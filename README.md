# Bank_Loan_analysis (creating intractive Dashboard using MS Excel)
## Project Objective
Bank Loan Analysis is to create a value lies in its ability to highlight potential risks and total loans report of 2021.so that bank can increase loans growth in 2022,2023.

## Dataset Used
- <a href="https://github.com/07bhanuprakash/Bank-Loans-Data-Analysis-Project/blob/main/Bank-Loan-Data.xlsx"> Dataset</a>

## Question KPI'S for (Summary Dashboard)
- Total Loan Applications: We need to calculate the total number of loan applications received during a specified period. Additionally, it is essential to monitor the Month-to-Date (MTD) Loan Applications and track changes Month-over-Month   (MoM)
- Total Funded Amount: Understanding the total amount of funds disbursed as loans is crucial. We also want to keep an eye on the MTD Total Funded Amount and analyse the Month-over-Month (MoM) changes in this metric.
- Total Amount Received: Tracking the total amount received from borrowers is essential for assessing the bank's cash flow and loan repayment. We should analyse the Month-to-Date (MTD) Total Amount Received and observe the Month-over-Month  (MoM) changes.
- Average Interest Rate: Calculating the average interest rate across all loans, MTD, and monitoring the Month-over-Month (MoM) variations in interest rates will provide insights into our lending portfolio's overall cost.
- Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI): Evaluating the average DII for our borrowers helps us gauge their financial health. We  need to compute the average DTI for all loans, MTD, and track Month-over-Month (MoM)fluctuations.

## question KPI'S for (overview Dashboard)
- Monthly Trends by Issue Date (Line Chart): To identify seasonality and long-term trends in lending activities
- Regional Analysis by State (Filled Map): To identify regions with significant lending activity and assess regional disparities
- Loan Term Analysis (Donut Chart): To allow the client to understand the distribution of loans across various term lengths.
- Employee Length Analysis (Bar Chart): How lending metrics are distributed among borrowers with different employment lengths, helping us assess the impact of employment history on loan applications.
-Loan Purpose Breakdown (Bar Chart): Will provide a visual breakdown of loan metrics based on the stated purposes of loans, aiding in the understanding of the primary reasons borrowers seek financing.
- Home Ownership Analysis (Tree Map): For a hierarchical view of how home ownership impacts loan applications andÂ disbursements.

## Process
-Identify the missing values and sort out them.
- Data is clean with respect to data type.
- create a pivot tables as per the questions asked.
- Merge all the pivot tables in to a dashboard and apply slicers to make it dynamic.

## Project insight
- Most of the loan applications are for debt consolidation.
- Loan applications are more frequent for customers with homeownership mortgage or rent.
- The state of California (CA) is contributing the most loan applications (79%).
- Customers are clearing their loans in a term of 36 months (90%).
- Customers have been consistently paying their loan amounts for more than 10 years.

## Final Conclusion 
To increase the bank's growth, it needs to:
- Increase loan applications from the state of California.
- Increase loan applications from those with home ownership (mortgage or rent).
- Increase loan amount for the purpose of debt consolidation.
- Increase the loan amounts for customers who are consistently paying their loans on time.

To reduce risk, customers should have a limited number of bank accounts, and their details must be verified before loans are sanctioned.
